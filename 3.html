                <p>Robots in the 20th century (January 1, 1901 and ended on December 31, 2000) progressed from simple machines in the early years to complex automatic machines by the time the century ended.  They became fitted with neural networks  and could act and respond in ways very similar to humans.
                    In 1921, the word ‘ROBOT’ was coined by Czech dramatist, Karel Capek in the context of mechanical people in a play called "R.U.R" (Rossum's Universal Robots)
                    This page describes some of the interesting robots of the 20th century in chronological order.

                                <h1>1.	1932  ROBOT LILLIPUT  </h1>
                                <p>The first true human shaped robot ever made was by the  Kuramochi Shoten Company in Japan in 1932. It was the first mass produced robot tin toy. It was named after the country of tiny people in Jonathan Swift’s 1726 fantasy Gulliver’s Travels
                                Robot Lilliput 5357 was a miniature toy made of tinplate and just 15 cm tall. The body was painted yellow with rows of tin knobs around it and circular graphs imitating the readings on a real computer. His square head  had a painted red mouth showing a set of sharp teeth.  He had large eyes, a sharp nose and claws for hand.
                                The ‘Lilliput’ was a wind-up toy. When wound, it  walked with large clumsy steps flailing its arms around in a chaotic manner.  
                                The picture on the box shows the robot walking forward with a puff of smoke coming out of his mouth and with a clear intention of destruction.
                                It was wildly popular   as soon as it was first produced. It is now an antique and a favourite of collectors around the world

                              <p>Elektro, the Moto-man was a   7 feet tall (2.1m), 260-pound robot which first appeared at the 1939-40 World’s Fair in New York City. Its height and humanoid  appearance made one of the most popular attractions in the fair.. 
                            Elektro's body consisted of a steel gear, a camera and a  motor skeleton covered by an aluminum skin. His eyes were photelectric cells which distinguish red and green light. He could walk by voice command, move his arms and turn his head,  count on its fingers, smoke cigarettes and  blow up balloons.
                            Using a 78-rpm record player, he could speak simple words and sentences with  a vocabulary of about 700 words. . He could say , "I am Elektro" and "My brain is bigger than yours". He introduced himself as “Ladies and gentlemen, I’ll be very glad to tell my story. I am a smart fellow as I have a very fine brain of 48 electrical relays.”
                            Elektro’s dog, Sparky, was added to the World’s Fair show in 1940. Sparko could move forward and back, sit down, turn its head, wag its tail, and bark. 
                            Both Elektro and Sparky have been retired and are now at Mansfield Memorial Museum.

                              <p>Shakey, produced by Stanford Research Institute (SRI International), is often described as "The first electronic person"  because it was the first mobile robot built to be controlled by artificial intelligence.
                                Standing a little less than 2 meters tall, it could move without human control and could see and avoid obstacles. 
                               It could perform tasks that required planning, route-finding, and the rearranging of simple objects. Unlike other robots which needed to be instructed on each individual step of completing a larger task, Shakey could analyze commands and break them down into basic chunks by itself and act on them. These actions involved traveling from one location to another, turning the light switches on and off, opening and closing the doors, climbing up and down from rigid objects, and pushing movable objects around.

                              <h1>4.	1969-1971 FREDDY and FREDDY II </h1>
                              <p>Freddy and Freddy II were robots built at the University of Edinburgh School of Informatics . Freddy Mark I (1969–1971) was an experimental prototype, with 3 degrees-of-freedom created by a rotating platform driven by a pair of independent wheels. Freddy II (1973–1976) was a 5 degrees of freedom manipulator with a large vertical 'hand' that could move up and down, rotate about the vertical axis and rotate objects held in its gripper around one horizontal axis  and were capable of assembling wooden blocks in a period of several hours.[
                            Freddy II was the best known of the two. It could utilise  a heavy robot arm fixed to an overhead gantry with adaptive grippers. A binocular vision system was also mounted to the fixed gantry. With these, it was able to assemble wooden models using vision to identify and locate the parts of a toy car and boat from a jumbled heap of  wooden pieces. It could then  assemble both in about 16 hours using a parallel gripper and single camera .

                              <p>The WABOT (  WAseda roBOT’)  was the first fun-scale anthropomorphic robot developed in the world at Tokyo's Waseda University under Ichiro Kato. The aim was to  develop a "personal robot" which resembled a person as much as possible.
                                The WABOT 1 was the first of a series. It was the first full-scale anthropomorphic robot built in the world. It consisted of a limb control system, a vision system, and a conversation system. Sensors allowed The Wabot-1 could measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors (sensors) for  artificial ears and eyes. It had a  artificial mouth with which it was able to communicate with a person in Japanese. The robot could walk and even grip and move objects with hands that used tactile sensors.
                                It was estimated that the WABOT-1 had the mental faculty of a one-and-half-year-old child.
